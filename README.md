## 📜 About Project
> As the first project of the cursus, it is meant to familiarize us with various functions and how they are designed internally.

```html
	🚀 We will solidify our knowledge of C usage and memory, both pointer usage and dynamic memory.
	in bonus part, we will introduce ourselves to linked lists usage
```
> [!NOTE]
> Because of 42 School norm requirements:
> * Each function can't have more than 25 lines of code.
> * All variables must be declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> * Project should be created just with allowed functions.
